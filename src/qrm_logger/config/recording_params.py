# RECORDING PARAMETERS
# =============================================================================

# Recording time in seconds
# dynamic property, managed by config.json
rec_time_default_sec = _toml["recording"]["rec_time_default_sec"]

# Frame rate for GNU Radio processing
frame_rate_default = _toml["recording"]["frame_rate_default"]

# wait time after changing the frequency
# Recommended values: RTLSDR 0.5, SDRplay 2
frequency_change_delay_sec = _toml["recording"]["frequency_change_delay_sec"]

# =============================================================================
# FFT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Spectrum range configuration for plot generation
# Used to set the dB scale limits on generated spectrum plots
# dynamic property, managed by config.json
min_db = _toml["recording"]["fft"]["min_db"]  # Minimum dB level for spectrum plots
# dynamic property, managed by config.json
max_db = _toml["recording"]["fft"]["max_db"]  # Maximum dB level for spectrum plots

# FFT size for spectrum analysis (must be power of 2)
# Higher values = better frequency resolution but slower processing
# Common values: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072
# dynamic property, managed by config.json (maps to 'fft_size')
fft_size_default = _toml["recording"]["fft"]["fft_size_default"]

# FFT Smoothing/Averaging Configuration
# avg_alpha controls exponential averaging of FFT data (0.0 to 1.0)
# 1.0 = no averaging (raw FFT data)
# 0.1 = heavy smoothing, 0.5 = moderate smoothing, 0.9 = light smoothing
fft_avg_alpha = _toml["recording"]["fft"]["fft_avg_alpha"]
